# Iris-Flower-Classification
I trained a Logistic Regression ML model to classify Iris flower species with 100% accuracy! ðŸ¥³ Here's a quick breakdown of my process:

1. Data Cleaning: Ensured the dataset was pristine.
2. Visual Analysis: Created insightful visualizations, including a violin plot to show the shape of flower sepals and petals. ðŸŒº
3. Model Training: Leveraged Logistic Regression using Python and Jupyter Notebook for seamless visualization.
4. Evaluation: Conducted rigorous prediction and accuracy tests to ensure top-notch performance.
